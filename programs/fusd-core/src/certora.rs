// breakthrough on the bitmap frontier. The recipe that makes it work, and WHY (each isolated by a cloud
// diagnostic, see certora/README.md §Bitmap-frontier):
//   1. CONCRETE bucket 0. The store index `bucket >> 6`, the read index, and the `1 << (bucket & 63)`
//      mask are all static — no array-update aliasing under a symbolic index (diag D1/D3 verify).
//   2. DIRECT add_member/remove_member (not via reconcile/target). Bypasses the `bucket_of`
//      classification. These two fns are `pub(crate)` + `#[cfg_attr(certora, inline(always))]` —
//      verification-only, behavior-neutral, so the prover sees their bodies (diag D4 verifies).
//   3. CONCRETE pre-count (0 for add / 1 for remove). This is the REAL fix: it makes the production
//      `checked_add`/`checked_sub` constant-fold, so the `.ok_or(FusdError::MathOverflow)?` Err branch is
//      provably dead and the slicer drops it. That Err branch is an INDIRECT `callx` (the
//      `From<FusdError>`/`core::fmt` conversion) which `-solanaSkipCallRegInst` translates to an EMPTY tac
//      block (SbfCFGToTAC.kt: skipped callx → `listOf()`), leaving R0/account-memory HAVOCED — the
//      original spurious counterexample. Diag D4 (no `?`) verifies; D5 (= D4 + `.ok_or(FusdError)?`)
//      FAILS, isolating this conclusively. A nondet count can't drive the fold, so the bound must be a
//      concrete pre-state, not a `cvlr_assume!`. The real `rb::set`/`rb::clear` IS still exercised
//      (empty↔non-empty transition), so B1/B2 stay live.
//   4. `precise_bitwise_ops true` (conf). `clear`'s `&= !(1<<k)` AND-complement mask needs precise
//      bitwise modeling; the math-int regime alone mis-modeled it (add, which uses `|=`, verified under
//      math-int; remove, which uses `&= !`, only verified once precise_bitwise_ops was added).
//   5. `-solanaCvtNondetAccountInfo true` (conf). Applies the precise TAC summary on the nondet account
//      (docs: required for Anchor projects; otherwise CVT_nondet_account_info is a no-op).
